\section{Literature Review}

The literature review will be performed with focus on two control methods: controllers that reduces roll during flight and path planners that alter the path with regards to roll and the ground path that is to be surveyed. The workings of hyperstpectral cameras will also be reviewed, and their usage with UAVs.
