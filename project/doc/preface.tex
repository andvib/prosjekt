\section*{Preface}

\vspace{2cm}

This paper has been developed as the result of project work performed in my fifth year of study at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Tor Arne Johansen for guidance and help with understanding the problem at hand and possible solutions. Thanks are also due to PhD candidate Kristoffer Gryte for letting me use and giving me technical support for his implementation of the UAV model, and to PhD candidate Jo√£o F. Fortuna for giving me an introduction to hyperspectral cameras.
