\section{ACADO toolkit}

The ACADO Toolkit \cite{acadoHOUSKA} is an open-source toolkit that supports several different methods for solving optimization problems. The toolkit provides methods to solve four different classes of optimization problem: Optimal control problems, multi-objective optimization and optimal control problems, parameter and state estimation problems, and model predictive control. Even though the toolkit will be used to create an MPC in this case, the optimal control problems (OCP) class will be used instead. This is because between each iteration of the MPC algorithm a new trajectory must be generated, and the MPC problem class does not have the functionality needed to do this. How the trajectory is calculated and how it is passed to the toolkit will be explained later in this chapter.

%To solve the optimization problems the toolkit uses many different algorithms. It also has its own Runge-Kutta and BDF integrators to simulate both ODE's (Ordinary Differential Equation) and DAE's (Differential Algebraic Equation). A MATLAB interface is also supplied by the toolkit, but this will not be used for this thesis.
