\chapter{Optimized Paths (Working Title)}


In this chapter an analysis of the optimized paths will be done. The MPC will be run on several different paths, and the discussion will focus on how the control problem is solved. Unless stated otherwise all of the optimizations have been performed at an altitude of $150$m and a cruising speed of $25$m/s.
