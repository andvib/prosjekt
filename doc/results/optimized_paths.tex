\chapter{Optimizing Paths}


In this chapter an analysis of paths optimized by the MPC will be performed. Several paths will be reviewed, and the discussion will focus on how the control problem is solved.

The optimizations will be performed at an altitude of $150$m unless stating otherwise. For other survey missions using a hyperspectral camera the altitude has been as low as $100$m \cite{hymsySUOMALAINEN}, and as high as $1900$m \cite{mosaicASMAT}. The cruising speed is set to $25$m/s, as this gives a stable trimmed flight.

\section{Turns}

In this section both linear and curved turns of different degrees will be optimized, and an analysis will be performed on the results.
