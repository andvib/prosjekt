\chapter{Optimized Paths (Working Title)}


In this chapter an analysis of the optimized paths will be done. The MPC will be run on several different paths, and the discussion will focus on how the control problem is solved.

The optimizations will be performed at an altitude of $150$m unless stating otherwise. There are no explicit reason for choosing this altitude. For other survey missions using a hyperspectral camera the altitude has been as low as $100$m \cite{hymsySUOMALAINEN}, and as high as $1900$m \cite{mosaicASMAT}. The crusing speed is set to $25$m/s, as this gives a stable trimmed flight.

\section{Turns}

In this section both linear and curved turns of different degrees will be optimized, and an analysis will be performed on the results.
