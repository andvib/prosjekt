REWRITE IF NONLINEAR IS NOT USED

In this thesis two different UAV models will be used, both of them are 6 DOF models presented by Beard \& McLain \cite{uavBEARD}. For simulations of the UAV the nonlinear model will be used, while a linearized version of this model will be used as the prediction model in the MPC that will be presented in chapter \ref{ch:optimization}. In this section the UAV states described by this model will be presented, as well as the linearization method. The linearization method will be the one described by Beard \& McLain \cite{uavBEARD}.

\subsection{UAV States}

The position of the UAV will be given using the North East Down (NED) coordinate frame denoted $\{n\}$:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{p}_{b/n}^n =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		N \\ E \\ D
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x_n \\ y_n \\ z_n
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

Following the notation used in \cite{uavBEARD}, the velocities of the UAV will be given in the body frame denoted $\{b\}$:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{V}^b_g =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		u \\ v \\ w
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The attitude $\bm{\Theta}_{nb}$ of the UAV will be given as Euler-angles, with the corresponding angular velocities $\bm{\dot{\Theta}}_{nb}$:

\begin{equation}
	\bm{\Theta}_{nb} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\phi \\ \theta \\ \psi
	\end{bmatrix},
	\hspace{5pt}
	\dot{\bm{\Theta}}_{nb} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		p \\ q \\ r
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}


\subsection{Linearizing the Model}

In order to ease computational load the \textit{linear decoupled model} of the UAV presented by Beard \& McLain \cite{uavBEARD} will be used in this thesis. While a linear model is not able to fully describe the motions of an aircraft, it is valid around the \textit{trimmed state} of the aircraft. An aircraft in its trimmed state will be able to maintain a straight level flight without any change in the control input, and since the UAV in this thesis is not expected to perform any high-angle maneuvers the linear model will be valid. An aircraft in the trimmed state satisfies the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{\dot{x}} = f(\mathbf{x}^*, \mathbf{u}^*) = 0.
\end{equation}

Linearization is performed by adding perturbations to the trimmed state solution, and the linearized states $\mathbf{\bar{x}}$ represent the perturbations away from the trimmed state \cite{modsimEGELAND}. The linearized state is defined as $\mathbf{\bar{x}} = \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}^*$, where $\mathbf{x}^*$ is the trimmed state.

The states of an aircraft are higly \textit{coupled}, meaning that they affect each other. This greatly increases the complexity of finding an optimal solution of the model since a change in one variable has effect on more than one state. For this reason the model is also decoupled into lateral and longitudinal models, where the states in one of the models does not affect the states in the other model. The lateral and longitudinal states are given as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	&\mathbf{\dot{x}}_{lat} = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		v \hspace{5pt} p \hspace{5pt} r \hspace{5pt} \phi \hspace{5pt} \psi
	\end{bmatrix} ^\intercal
	, \mathbf{u}_{lat} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\delta_a \hspace{5pt} \delta_r
	\end{bmatrix}^\intercal \\
	&\mathbf{\dot{x}}_{lon} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		u \hspace{5pt} w \hspace{5pt} q \hspace{5pt} \theta \hspace{5pt} h
	\end{bmatrix}^\intercal
	, \mathbf{u}_{lon} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\delta_e \hspace{5pt} \delta_t
	\end{bmatrix}^\intercal.
\end{split}
\end{equation}


%\section{Wind and Airspeed}
%Wind will be introduced to the vehicle in order to test how the system withstands disturbances. Since the camera footprint is dependent only on the attitude angles of the aircraft and not the course of the aircraft, the wind will only affect the navigation of the UAV. Wind speed is given in the $\{n\}$ frame as \cite{uavBEARD}

%\begin{equation}
%	\mathbf{V}^n_w =
%	\begin{bmatrix}
%		w_n \\ w_e \\ w_d
%	\end{bmatrix},
%\end{equation}

%and the air speed $\mathbf{V}_a$ of the aircraft is given by the wind speed $\mathbf{V}_w$ and ground speed $\mathbf{V}_g$ as

%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%	\mathbf{V}_a & = \mathbf{V}_g - \mathbf{V}_w\\
%	\begin{bmatrix}
%		u_r \\ v_r \\ w_r
%	\end{bmatrix}
%	& =
%	\begin{bmatrix}
%		u \\ v \\ w
%	\end{bmatrix}
%	- \mathbf{R}_n^b
%	\begin{bmatrix}
%		w_n \\ w_e \\ w_d
%	\end{bmatrix}
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

%where $\mathbf{R}_n^b$ is the rotation matrix between the NED frame $\{n\}$ and the body frame $\{b\}$. 

%% Is the last part really needed?

%When in the presence of wind, the heading of the UAV isn't necessarily the direction that the UAV is moving. Wind will introduce a crab angle $\chi_c$ that together with the heading $\psi$ gives the course angle $\chi$:
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\chi = \psi + \chi_c.
%\end{equation}
