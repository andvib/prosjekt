What is captured by the camera, the camera footprint, when the camera is fixed to the aircraft body is dependent of the position and the attitude angles of the aircraft. In this section a model for calculating the camera footprint on the ground assuming flat earth will be presented, as well as the necessary UAV states for this thesis.
