\section{Kinematics}

When the camera is fixed to the aircraft body, what is actually captured by the camera, the camera footprint, depends on the angles of the aircraft. The equations needed to express the position of the centre and outer points of the camera footprint will be given here. The kinematic model for the UAV used in this paper will also be given here.


\subsection{UAV States}

The position of the UAV will be given using the North East Down (NED) coordinate frame, denoted $\{n\}$:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{p}_{b/n}^n =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		N \\ E \\ D
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x_n \\ y_n \\ z_n
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

The attitude of the UAV will be given as Euler-angles:

\begin{equation}
	\bm{\Theta}_{nb} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\phi \\ \theta \\ \psi
	\end{bmatrix}	
\end{equation}

with corresponding angular velocities:

\begin{equation}
	\dot{\bm{\Theta}}_{nb} =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		p \\ q \\ r
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Camera Footprint}

The camera footprint is coupled with all of the three angles given in $\bm{\Theta}$. The position of the camera footprint will be calculated using forward kinematics, and the "SITUATION" is shown in figure \ref{fig:footprint_centre}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Centre Position}

The attitude of the UAV is given in the body frame $\{b\}$ and the height $z_n$ is given in the NED frame $\{n\}$, and the model assumes flat earth. The position of the footprint centre point $\mathbf{c}_b^b$ in the body frame $\{b\}$ is expressed as the geometric (???) distance from the UAV position to the footprint centre point:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{c}_b^b =
	\begin{bmatrix}
		c_{x/b}^b \\ c_{y/b}^b
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		z_n tan(\theta) \\ z_n tan(\phi)
	\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
