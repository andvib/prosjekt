\section{Optimization}

In this chapter the methods and equations used for the optimization problem will be given. The goal of the optimization problem is to minimize the distance between the centre of the camera footprint and the path that is to be observed. The optimization program/routine/algorithm will be given as an offline Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem, that includes the entire UAV model as constraints.
