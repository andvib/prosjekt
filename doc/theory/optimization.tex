\section{Optimization}

%Optimization techniques is a common way to control UAVs, both as online and offline systems. An online optimization system can measure the current states of the aircraft, and based on that calculate the optimal input depending on the final state. An offline system, which will be developed in this paper, calculates the states and inputs before the flight has actually taken place. An offline solution is often simpler as an optimization system tends to require a great deal of computing power.
