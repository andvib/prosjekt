Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a term used to describe control methods that uses knowledge about the process to calculate the future control inputs to the system in order to follow a reference trajectory \cite{mpcCAMACHO}. In this chapter the equations for an \textit{offline intervalwise MPC} that seeks to minimize the distance between the camera centre point and the ground path that is to be observed will be given. A linear state space-model for the UAV will be used to predict the future states and control inputs.
