\section{Simulation of Controller}

For the simulation the controller was implemented in Simulink, and it operates alongside the autopilot described in chapter \ref{ch:simulation}. Since the controller will be used to control course using the rudder, the autopilot will be controlling all the other states and actuators.


\subsection{Controller Implementation}

The controller was implemented using a simple block diagram in Simulink, with desired course as input and rudder control as output. As a starting point for the controller tuning the control loop was simulated in an open loop. 

\subsection{Test Cases}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Cases
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $45\degree$ turn
		\item $90\degree$ turn
		\item $45\degree$ followed by $45\degree$
		\item Wind
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
