\section{Simulation of Controller}

For the simulation the controller was implemented in Simulink, and it operates alongside the autopilot described in chapter \ref{ch:simulation}. Since the controller will be used to control course using the rudder, the autopilot will be controlling all the other states and actuators.


\subsection{Controller Implementation}

The controller was implemented using a simple block diagram in Simulink, with desired course as input and rudder control as output. Before the simulations were run the controller was tested and tuned in order to see that the controller works (*!*!*!). 

\subsection{Test Cases}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Cases
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $45\degree$ turn
		\item $90\degree$ turn
		\item $45\degree$ followed by $45\degree$
		\item Wind
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
