\section{Simulation}
\label{ch:simulation}

The simulations of the controller will be performed using Matlab, with a model of the Aerosonde UAV. 

\subsection{Model}

The model of the Aerosonde UAV is based on parameters and equations given by Beard \& McLain \cite{suaBEARD}. (Referere til Gryte?)

The model is split into to parts, kinematics and forces. The kinematics module implements all the aircraft-specific equations and parameters, 


\subsection{Autopilot}

The autopilot used in the simulations have also been developed by Gryte (Skal det refereres?), and it is also based on equations in Beard \& McLain \cite{suaBEARD}. The autopilot have previously been used with a different UAV, and therefore needed to be tuned to work with the Aerosonde. The controller loops are defined by relative damping factor $\zeta$ and natural frequency $\omega$, and by implementing the control loops outside the model the parameters can be found seperately. This makes a good starting point for further tuning.
