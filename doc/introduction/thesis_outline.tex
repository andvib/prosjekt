\section{Thesis Outline}

In chapter 2 the equations for the UAV model used in this thesis will be given, as well as the kinematic model used to compute the camera position on the ground. In chapter 3 the equations needed to create an offline intervalwise MPC that seeks to minimize the distance between the camera centre point on the ground and the ground path that is to be observed will be given. In chapter 4 the software implementation of the MPC using the ACADO Toolkit will be presented, and in chapter 5 the simulation environment will be presented.

In chapter 6 the performance of the software implementation of the MPC will be analyzed to state what it is capable of. Some of the paths optimized in chapter 6 will in chapter 7 be used to guide an UAV in simulations. Discussion and conclusion of the thesis will be given in chapter 8 and 9 respectively.

The complete state space model of the UAV will be presented in appendix A. In appendix B the optimization algorithm implemented using the ACADO Toolkit will be presented, and in appendix C the code used to create the offline intervalwise MPC will be presented.
