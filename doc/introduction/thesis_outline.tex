\section{Thesis Outline}

In Chapter 2 the equations for the UAV model used in this thesis will be given, as well as the kinematic model used to compute the camera position on the ground. In Chapter 3 the equations needed to create an offline intervalwise MPC that seeks to control the camera centre point is given. In Chapter 4 the software implementation of the MPC using the ACADO Toolkit will be presented, and in Chapter 5 the simulation environment will be presented.

In Chapter 6 the performance of the software implementation of the MPC will be analyzed to state what it is capable of. In Chapter 7 a path optimized in Chapter 6 will be used to guide a UAV using a software-in-the-loop simulator. Discussion and conclusion of the thesis will be given in Chapter 8 and 9 respectively.

The complete state space model of the UAV will be presented in Appendix A, together with linear equations for the aerodynamic coefficients. In Appendix B the parameters used for the application will be given, and in Appendix C the algorithms for the offline intervalwise MPC will be given.

This thesis is a continuation of project work performed during the fall semester 2016 \cite{prosjekt}. The introduction of hyperspectral imaging in Section \ref{sec:hyper} was done for this project, and the equations used to calculate the camera position in Chapter \ref{ch:kinematics} is built on work done for this project.
