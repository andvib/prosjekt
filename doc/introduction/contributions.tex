\section{Contributions}

This paper will investigate a control method for fixed wing UAVs that will minimize the distance between what is intended to be observed, and what is actually observed when a fixed hyperspectral camera is used for ground observation. The goal of the thesis is to develop software able to generate an optimal path that can be used to survey a pre-defined ground path. The contributions from the thesis are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A kinematic model to calculate the position of the camera footprint on the ground based on the attitude of the UAV
    \item An offline intervalwise MPC that, given a pre-defined parametrized ground path, calculates an optimal path the UAV may follow in order to minimize the error between what is to be observed and what is actually captured
    \item A software implementation of the offline intervalwise MPC using the ACADO Toolkit
    \item A software-in-the-oop simulator to test the performance of the path using an pre-existing autopilot
\end{itemize}
