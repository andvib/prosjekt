\chapter*{Preface}

\vspace{1cm}

This paper is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Science degree at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

This paper is a continuation of research performed for project work fall 2016 \cite{prosjekt}. 

I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Tor Arne Johansen for guidance and help with understanding the problem at hand and possible solutions. A big thanks go to PhD Candidate Siri Holthe Mathisen for always leaving her office door slightly open, so I could ask questions whenever problems occurred. Thanks are also due to PhD candidate Kristoffer Gryte for letting me use and giving me technical support for his implementation of the UAV model, and to PhD candidate Jo√£o F. Fortuna for giving me an introduction to hyperspectral cameras.

And last but not least, I would like to thank my family for their support, even though they still, after five years, are not completely sure what cybernetics actually is.
