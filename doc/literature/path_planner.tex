\subsection{Path Planner}
When an UAV is to operate autonomously there are other things than controlling the UAV states that needs to be taken into consideration. The path planner plays an important role in telling the controllers what the states should be. There exists many different path planners depending on the situation. A path planner may, for example, be used to aviod controlled flight into surface in mountainous areas based on maps, or it can be used in search and rescue missions to calculate in which area it is most likely to find people. In this case the path planner will be used to follow a predetermined path in order to observe the ground with a camera.


\subsubsection{Path Planner for Ground Observation}
Many path planners today are based on the result Dubin presented in 1957 \cite{DUBIN}: the shortest path between two points in a two dimensional space consists of two circular arcs connected by a straight line. It has also been shown that the same principles can be used in three dimensions \cite{dubinsBEARD}. 

Dubin's path for UAVs can be used in several situations, and in \cite{dubinFixedWingLUGO} it is demonstrated how a Dubin's path generator can be used to search for a missing person within a given area. The path is generated by a path generater, which then transmits the path to the path-following strategy. This strategy controls the low-level autopilot. The autopilot is responsible for maintaining a constant altitude and constant airspeed, while the path generator includes a constraint to ensure it does not generate a path which requires the UAV to exceed its maximum turning rate. When the UAV finds a point of interest, a path that circulates the point is generated. The path generator is simulated, and shows that Dubin's path is a valid choice for UAV operation.

As mentioned previously in this paper, an airplane may be turned without banking by using the rudder. This strategy for airplane control can also be used in path planning, as was done by Yokoyama and Ochi \cite{skidPathYOKO}. A path planner based on Dubin's path was created with skid-to-turn dynamics in mind and compared with an rigorous optimization algorithm, in order to check the quasi-optimality of the Dubins's-based path. The results show that the Dubin's path algorithm always returned a feasible path that is quasi-optimal. The Dubin's path algorithm was fast, with a mean computational time of $61.9\mu s$, which the report concludes is fast enough for the algorithm to be used for online calculations.
