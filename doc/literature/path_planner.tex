\subsection{Path Planner}
When an UAV is to operate autonomously there are other things than controlling the UAV states that needs to be taken into consideration. The path planner plays an important role in telling the controllers what the states should be. There exists many different path planners depending on the situation. A path planner may, for example, be used to aviod controlled flight into surface in mountainous areas based on mpas, or it can be used in search and rescue missions to calculate in which area it is most likely to find people. Int this case the path planner will be used to follow a predetermined path in order to observe the ground with a camera.
