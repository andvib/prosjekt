\section{Heading controller}
Heading is normally controlled by using the aileron. This, of course, introduces big changes in the roll angle of the UAV, which is a big challenge when observing the ground using a fixed camera. In an attempt to reduce this change in roll angle, so that previous trajectory planners may be used. This section will look into different strategies and different controllers that can be used.
