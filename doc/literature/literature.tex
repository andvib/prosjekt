\section{Literature Review}

The literature review will be done with focus on two control methods: a controller that reduces roll during flight, and a path planner that alters the path with regards to roll and the ground points that are to be observed. The workings of hyperstpectral cameras will also be reviewed, and their usage with UAVs.
